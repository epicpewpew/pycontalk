### Git ![git](/assets/images/gitlogo.png)
###### runs on your computer

Git is a versioning software crafted by the most gracious and glorious **Linus Torvalds**, BDFL, free software!.

_The guys in marketing will say:_ "Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency."

It helps you manage suffering like:

### GitHub ![octocat](/assets/images/octocat.png)
###### runs in the cloud (somebody elses computer)

GitHub is what you get when techno-anarchists who love open source technology build a community around git.

_The guys in marketing will say:_ "Github is the best way to build software together. GitHub provide tools for easier collaboration and code sharing from any device. Start collaboating with millions of developers today!"
# Lets talk about Git...

Setting up your local environment

> git config --global user.name "Your Name Comes Here"

> git config --global user.email you@yourdomain.example.com

## The Repository
This is where your project exists, this is your baby, your lifes work, the thing you hold most dear - as far is git is concerned. How do you get a repository?

How do you get one of those
```bash
git clone <"URL to the repo you want goes here">
```
A folder becomes a repository once it initialised:

```bash
git init
```
Or you can fork a repo that is already there.

```bash
git fork
```

### And what all this looks like

adding files for versioning
``` bash
git add file_1 file_2 file_3
```

### make your changes

I haz no picture for this

### commit

this saves whatever changes you have made in the repository

```bash
 git commit
```
* * *

#### The branch

### ![](/assets/images/thebranch.png)

**_make one with_**
```bash
git branch "\<name of new branch here\>"
```
**_switch to a branch with_**
```bash
git checkout "\<name of branch\>"
```
**_there is a one liner to do both_**
```bash
 git checkout -b "\<branch name here\>"
```

#### What does it look like now?

#### Now merge your branches

### But teh command line is a dark and ominous place
Git status is your friend

```bash
git status
```
#### You can use these friendly tools.

GitHub Desktop

## Now that we have that out of the way
###### ![suspect](/assets/images/suspect.png)

The best way to build software together. This implies community, this implies collaboration, this implies a fair amount of sharing. The hard part of Github isn't understanding git it is the sharing part the trips up most people.

## Contributing to opensource ![pencil2](/assets/images/pencil2.png)
Opensource software is much like that delicious thing we call Jollof rice. There is no one true jollof recipe and no one true way to cook or serve it  (Team Nigeria, Team Senengal and others please don't kill me) and no one can lay exclusive claim on it. Jollof is essentially a product of opensource shenanigans.

### Babys First Contribution ![baby](/assets/images/baby_symbol.png)

So you want to contribute but where do you start? Most opensource projects will tell you **how** to contribute but will not tell you **where** to contribute. While a lot of maintainers will argue "show me the code" this at most times is not what they need. What hinders the success of opensource projects is:

1.  Incomplete or confusing documentation

    * Help write the wiki, README, usage docs, most maintainers are either, too busy, have lost interest, on vacation , too lazy, kidnapped by the paid-software-mafia or all of the above.

    * As most of it goes: get a wumbus connect to whozits and chooch the thingamabobby.


2.  Unresponsiveness

    * Know the answer to an issue? responsed to it if you can or tag some you know who does.

3.  Dismissive responses

4.  Conflict

5.  Unexplained Rejection

6.  Unwelcoming Language or content

    * be gracious, kind, and try to be awesome to those who interact with.
